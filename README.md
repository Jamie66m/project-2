# JJDB ðŸŽ¥

Made by [Jamie Maxwell](https://github.com/Jamie66m) and [Joao Pinto](https://github.com/jdpintoGA)

## Overview

[Check out <strong>JJDB</strong> here](http://jamie66m.github.io/project-2/)

JJDB is a front-end web application built using React and a public API, allowing users to search for and compare their favourite movies. This was my second project at General Assembley and by the start of the project we had moved on from just 'vanilla' JavaScript, HTML and CSS to incorporating npm, webpack, babel and front-end frameworks and libraries.  

Joao and myself both decided quickly that we wanted to do a movie inspired app due to our shared passion in movies. We wanted to create an app where we could incorporate new features that we hadn't yet learn't in the classroom and make it look visually appealing to a user.

## The Brief
The app should:

* **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.
